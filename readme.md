### Description

The landing page of this mock website displays a trendy, fresh, eccommerce website. Company values are paired with stock images, and a list of fake reviews give their testimony as to how awesome their shopping experience is.

The opening screen invites the user to start shopping right away, but allows them to scroll to learn more about the website. At the end the user is prompted again to visit the shopping page to begin shopping.

The shopping page is populated from an array of available products. Adding another item to the page requires only adding a new object to the array, with the option of adding discounted prices when buying mulitples.

Users click a product card, and the a modal prompts them to select how many, what the price is, and any discounts. Adding the product to the cart updates the side panel with the new total price, and discounts, and a breakdown of the number of each item in the cart.

The cart is saved via local storage, so page refreshes and navigation don't destroy the user's progress. When ready to checkout the user is prompted by a modal and the shopping cart is "emptied". No transaction takes place as this is just a mockup.
